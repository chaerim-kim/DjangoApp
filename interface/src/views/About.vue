        <p>
          Students can comment on and rate their school as well, by visiting
          their school's Rate My Professors page.
          Rate My Professors is built
          for college students. Choosing the best courses and professors is a
          rite of passage for every student, and connecting with peers on the
          site has become a key way for millions of students to navigate this
          process. The site does what students have been doing forever -
          checking in with each other – their friends, their brothers, their
          sisters, their classmates – to figure out who's a great professor and
          who's one you might want to avoid.
